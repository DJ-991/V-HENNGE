For hands-on I choose Vue.js for its frontend-development. (Faster and easy to compile and build)

1. I started with HTML5, CSS3 for developing and styling and Bootstrap 4.5 for responsive design which helps in mobile view compaitibility. 

2. Because it is totally custom design so, i took me more time for designing & developing from CSS3 prespective.

3. Media query for large and small screen also includes for Responsive view design for all types of Mobiles and iPad's.

4. It took me less than a week to complete this from logically,dynamically as well as design development prespective.

5. For logical end used vanilla JS and also Vue.js syntax's which took less time to complete this hands on.

6. Also UI tested in Web view, iPad's as well as Mobile views(iPhones and Android) for which bootstrap 4.5 and Media Query implemented.

7. For better user experience two date-pickers for web view and one date-picker for Mobile view is implemented.
