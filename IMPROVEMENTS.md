Improvement Suggestions:

1. DataTable should have another colums to filter data by time and date sepreately(depends on backend data also). So that user can check data date wise and time wise for a date.

2. For Mobile View DateRanger-Picker should be centered for better user experience.

3. For Mobile view data should be expanded and collapse if mail having more than one email id's, that design is not there for mobile view and web view.(Reg: Mission 2)

4. In datatable `To` column has small design of rectangle with +emails, I improve it so when user click on that small pop-up of color grey have other email id's. 

5. Application wise for User interface need change in colors and all as:
(

  (a). As an application there should be one fixed color of an application which recognizes the App 

  (b). Calender icon and Search icon should have their own color so that user can identify them.

  (c). In Data-Table in Subject there should have some color which is clickable.

  (d). Attachment icon also can be improved with color for better experience.
